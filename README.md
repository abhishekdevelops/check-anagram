# 🔄 Check If Two Strings Are Anagrams – JavaScript Logic Project

This JavaScript project checks whether two strings are **anagrams** of each other.  
It uses string normalization, sorting, and comparison logic.  
The result is printed in the browser console.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Takes two strings as input
- Converts both strings to lowercase
- Splits, sorts, and rejoins their characters
- Compares the normalized strings
- Prints whether they are anagrams or not

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Working with string methods like `.toLowerCase()`, `.split()`, `.sort()`, `.join()`
- Using a helper function with arguments
